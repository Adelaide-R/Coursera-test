          <p class="food">Perk up your poultry with our top chicken dishes. We've got you covered whether it's a
            traditional roast, an exotic curry or a comforting pie you're after. We recommend our garlic chicken
            breasts, chicken breasts in an irresistible garlic sauce filled with caramelized onions and garlic... a
            winner of a chicken dinner! <br>
            Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising
            them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine
            of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.<br>
            Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and
            boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared
            chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat,
            with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.<br>
            The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different
            parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods,
            while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations
            estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.
            <br>
            Chicken can be cooked in many ways. It can be made into sausages, skewered, put in salads, traditionally
            grilled or by using electric grill, breaded and deep-fried, or used in various curries. There is significant
            variation in cooking methods amongst cultures. Historically common methods include roasting, baking,
            broasting, and frying.
            <br>
            Western cuisine frequently has chicken prepared by deep frying for fast foods such as fried chicken, chicken
            nuggets, chicken lollipops or Buffalo wings. They are also often grilled for salads or tacos. Chickens often
            come with labels such as "roaster", which suggest a method of cooking based on the type of chicken. While
            these labels are only suggestions, ones labeled for stew often do not do well when cooked with other
            methods.
            Some chicken breast cuts and processed chicken breast products include the moniker "with rib meat". This is
            a misnomer, as it refers to the small piece of white meat that overlays the scapula, removed along with the
            breast meat. The breast is cut from the chicken and sold as a solid cut, while the leftover breast and true
            rib meat is stripped from the bone through mechanical separation for use in chicken franks, for example.
            Breast meat is often sliced thinly and marketed as chicken slices, an easy filling for sandwiches. Often,
            the tenderloin (pectoralis minor) is marketed separately from the breast (pectoralis major). In the US,
            "tenders" can be either tenderloins or strips cut from the breast. In the UK the strips of pectoralis minor
            are called "chicken mini-fillets".
            Chicken bones are hazardous to health as they tend to break into sharp splinters when eaten, but they can be
            simmered with vegetables and herbs for hours or even days to make chicken stock.
            <br>
            In Asian countries it is possible to buy bones alone as they are very popular for making chicken soups,
            which are said to be healthy. <br>
            In Australia the rib cages and backs of chickens after the other cuts have
            been removed are frequently sold cheaply in supermarket delicatessen sections as either "chicken frames" or
            "chicken carcasses" and are purchased for soup or stock purposes.
